## Caramel Macchiato 
Starbucks Cafe Americano is Excellent! You can enjoy this drink in both seasons because it's a versatile coffee. Just 5 calories in 8 (fl oz) short cup.

I have researched more about coffee and found that this is the best coffee in the world. Drinking this at breakfast is a fantastic way to start your morning!
